# Plagiarism Test Samples

## 1. Exact Copy (100% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are clear indicators that our planet is warming at an unprecedented rate. The primary cause of this warming is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion."

**Text B:**

## 2. Paraphrased/Synonym Replacement (70-85% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way we process information. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. This technology has applications in healthcare, finance, and transportation industries."

**Text B:**
"AI has transformed how we handle information processing. ML algorithms can examine large datasets to recognize patterns and generate forecasts. This tech has uses in medical, financial, and automotive sectors."

## 3. Structural Plagiarism (60-75% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"The water cycle consists of four main processes: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. First, water evaporates from oceans and lakes. Then, it condenses into clouds. Next, it falls as rain or snow. Finally, it collects in bodies of water, and the cycle repeats."

**Text B:**
"There are four primary stages in the water cycle: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Initially, water transforms into vapor from seas and rivers. Subsequently, this vapor forms clouds through condensation. Following this, precipitation occurs as rain or snow. Lastly, water gathers in reservoirs, continuing the cyclical process."

## 4. Idea Plagiarism (40-60% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"Social media platforms have significantly impacted modern communication. People now share personal experiences instantly with global audiences. This has created new opportunities for businesses to reach customers but also raised concerns about privacy and mental health."

**Text B:**
"The rise of digital networking sites has fundamentally changed how we interact. Users can broadcast their daily lives to worldwide communities in real-time. While this opens marketing channels for companies, it simultaneously generates worries about data protection and psychological wellbeing."

## 5. Completely Original (0-20% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"The ancient art of pottery involves shaping clay into functional or decorative objects. Skilled artisans use various techniques such as wheel throwing, hand building, and glazing to create unique pieces. Each pottery tradition reflects the cultural heritage of its region."

**Text B:**
"Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to information processing. Unlike classical computers that use binary bits, quantum computers utilize quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This enables them to solve complex mathematical problems exponentially faster."

## 6. Mosaic Plagiarism (Mixed Sources) (50-70% Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are becoming increasingly important. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. Wind turbines harness kinetic energy from moving air. These technologies reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help combat climate change."

**Text B:**
"Sustainable energy alternatives such as solar and wind are gaining significance. Photovoltaic cells in solar panels transform sunlight into electrical energy. Wind generators capture kinetic energy from air movement. These innovations decrease fossil fuel reliance and contribute to fighting global warming."

## 7. Citation/Reference Style (Low Similarity Expected)

**Text A:**
"According to Smith (2023), climate change affects agricultural productivity. The study shows that temperature increases of 2°C can reduce crop yields by 15-20%. This finding is supported by research from the International Agricultural Institute."

**Text B:**
"Research by Johnson et al. (2024) indicates that rising temperatures impact farming output. Their analysis demonstrates that a 2-degree warming could decrease agricultural production by 15-20%. Similar conclusions were reached by the Global Food Security Center."

## 8. Technical/Scientific Content (Variable Similarity)

**Text A:**
"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. The equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle."

**Text B:**
"Plants transform light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. The chemical equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This occurs in chloroplasts via two primary phases: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle."

## 9. Creative Writing (Subjective Similarity)

**Text A:**
"The old oak tree stood majestically in the center of the meadow. Its gnarled branches reached toward the sky like ancient fingers, while its roots ran deep into the earth. Children often played in its shade during summer afternoons, their laughter echoing through the leaves."

**Text B:**
"A magnificent oak dominated the meadow's heart. Its twisted limbs stretched skyward like weathered hands, while its roots penetrated deep into the soil. Young ones frequently gathered beneath its canopy on warm summer days, their joyful voices resonating among the foliage."

## 10. News/Current Events (Factual Similarity)

**Text A:**
"The stock market experienced significant volatility today, with the Dow Jones falling 2.3% by market close. Technology stocks were particularly affected, with major companies seeing double-digit losses. Analysts attribute this decline to concerns about inflation and interest rate increases."

**Text B:**
"Today's trading session saw considerable market turbulence, as the Dow Jones dropped 2.3% at closing. Tech sector stocks bore the brunt of the selling, with leading firms posting substantial percentage losses. Financial experts link this downturn to inflation fears and potential rate hikes."
